## General guidelines when starting on a new project

### 1. Cloning of repository

This is probably not needed when you start on a new project given that the underlying assumption is that you already have your github repo connected to local IDE - in my case I like to use VS Code. To be honest, I'm probably writing this section to get into the habit of writing documentation, especially as a README file, as this is often the most overlooked part of the project process. Mostly because this is the more mundane and less interesing phase of the project. But enought chit-chat, time to fill this page up to make it look less sad while also getting into the process familirisng the syntax of writing such documentation.

1.1 Generating SSH Key

Before cloning the repo to your local directory, you need to make sure that you have the correct access rights before cloning. So once you've `cd` into the directory in which you want to clone the repo to, run the termical command `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com` to generate your SSH key - You can find the commands and more detailed explanation of doing so here ->[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
